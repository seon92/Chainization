# Chainization
Official pytorch implementation of ECCV 2022 paper, "Order Learning Using Partially Ordered Data via Chainization."


## Quick Start : Train Model on Random Edge Cases

You can adjust supervision ratio by changing 'info_ratio' in the parse_option function.

* for Adience dataset

```

    $ python train_chainize_adience.py 
```

* for MORPH II dataset

```

    $ python train_chainize_morph.py
```
